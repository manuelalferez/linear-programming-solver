# Linear programming solver 

[**Linear programming**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) is an **optimization** technique for a system of **linear** constraints and a **linear** objective function. An objective function defines the quantity to be optimized, and the goal of **linear programming** is to find the values of the variables that maximize or minimize the objective function.

## Goal üèÜ

Develop an algorithm to solve problems of maximization in Linear Programming.



## Guidelines üßæ

Implement the `simplexTableu` method for maximization problems. Bliss
implementation should request the necessary information to resolve any
maximization linear programming problem. Once these values are obtained, the program should provide the solution to the problem.

The implemented simplex method can be executed in console or
it can include a graphical interface with a minimum of functionalities. 

The program must be able to:

* insert the variables
* the objective function 
* the constraints of the problem 

Additional characteristics: Preloaded problems, via a configuration/data file.
